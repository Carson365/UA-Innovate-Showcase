This is the code for our* project submission for UA-Innovate. The competition instructions can be found in PromptGuide.docx, and the dataset can be found at https://github.com/hca-foundation/employee_heirarchy_deidentified as mentioned or is included in this repository as orgchart_faux.zip.

The project is obviously the product of a 24-hour competition, and is lacking much of the polish and several of the features we would have hoped to include in a final version of this project. It is also likely not foloowing several best practices, but such is the nature of a first prototype.
